This repo contains the work carried out during the Google Summer of Code 2014.
Participated Company - WSO2
Time Period - 19th May to 18th August

The project is about developing BAM toolbox for WSO2 Business Process 
Server(BPS). BAM is known as Business Activity Monitor which is mainly used for
big data analysis. In BPS there are two kinds of processes. They are BPEL
processes and human task processes. Those two processes generates events and
those can be monitored using WSO2 BAM. The project details can be found in [1].

The approach used for implementing, can be found in [2]. In [3] contains how to
add the implemented event listeners and the toolbox to WSO2 BPS and WSO2 BAM
respectively.

Below is the folder structure used for implementation.

*** Deliverables - Contains all the deliverables in one location
*** bpelevents - Another approach used for implementing event listeners and data
publisher. Contains the WSO2 BAM toolbox
*** bps-stats - Contains the carbon component which implemented using above source code.
